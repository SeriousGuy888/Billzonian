# Coining Words for Billzonian

### Word Coining Conventions

Billzonian words are coined in three main ways.

In order of preference, they are:

1. Derived through compounding, combining, shortening, mutating, reanalyzing and deconstructing, or analogy with existing Billzonian words  
>  `akrat` â†’ `unkrat` "no; wrong"  
>  `chambi` â†’ `jambi` "much; many"  
>  `owosome` â†’ `owo` "to be happy or glad"  
1. Derived from English words  
>  `accurate` â†’ `akrat` "yes; correct"  
>  `owo` â†’ `owosome` "good; gladdening"  
>  `as well` â†’ `zel` "and; also; with"  
1. Randomly; whatever sounds cool  
>  `apugongawklu` "interrogation"  
>  `kakamalaka` "garbage"  
>  `chambiwambi` "big chicken"  

New words should preferably be coined using the first method, but if not possible, one of the other methods of coining the word should be used.
