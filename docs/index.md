## About Billzonian
The goal of Billzonian is to take a language that is initially just a variant of English,
and slowly and naturally evolve it to make it its own separate language.

The evolution is done through people speaking Billzonian. A feature, word, or pronunciation of a word
that becomes popular among the speakers is what is actually documented.

Most of the vocabulary is based on English words (eg: `bea`, `fakture`), but some words are borrowed
from elsewhere, (eg: `kinematorium`) or randomly coined (eg: `chambiwambi`). Some words are derived
from existing Billzonian words, like how `jambi`, meaning many, is derived from `chambi`, meaning big.
My hope is that eventually, we will have a vocabulary that allows for speech without English words.
