### Conjunctions

What I am currently trying to do with Billzonian is to replace the
English conjunctions with newly derived Billzonian ones.

Here is the progress of doing that so far:

| English | Billzonian |
|---------|------------|
| for     | -          |
| and     | zel        |
| nor     | -          |
| but     | howf       |
| or      | terv?      |
| yet     | -          |
| so      | therf      |

### Structuring Questions

In English, questions are formed by flipping the verb and the subject of the sentence (often using the auxiliary verb `do`),
and moving the object to the start of the sentence if it has to be replaced with a question word.
> You murdered everyone.  
  Who did you murder?

In cases without a question word, you just flip the subject and the verb.
> You committed the murder.  
  Did you commit the murder?

\
In Billzonian, I want to change this structure to one where there is no word flipping or moving the question word to
the start of the sentence. Like so:
> Yu jakobised reghyume.  
  Yu jakobised qwo?

In cases without a question word, instead of flipping the subject
and verb, I add a particle `duz` to the end of the sentence. Like so:
> Yu akted c jakobisement.  
  Yu akted c jakobisement duz?\*

\* *The particle `duz` would be optional where a question mark would be
present or where the rising tone of one's voice would indicate a question.*
