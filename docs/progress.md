# Plans & Progress

### Elimination of the Present Progressive Tense

The *present progressive tense* is represented in English using the auxiliary word `to be` and the suffix `-ing`.
As opposed to the *simple present tense*, which does not use any auxiliary verb.
> **PPT:** I am sleeping.  
  **SPT:** I sleep.

In Billzonian, my goal is to eliminate the present progressive tense's distinction from the simple present tense.
Both of these sentences could correctly be translated as `I hibernate`.

However, sometimes the present progressive tense sometimes conveys important information.  
Consider the following:
> The sun is setting.  
  The sun sets.

The first sentence says that the sun is setting as the speaker speaks.  
The second states merely that the sun does regularly set.

Therefore, in Billzonian, this proposition would eliminate the `-ing` suffix as well as the `to be` auxiliary verb.
However, where a distinction between the two is important, the adverb `kurrly`, meaning `currently` is used.
Therefore, the example above would translate like so:
> C sun kurrly sets.  
  C sun sets.

However, this adverb is always optional and only is used for clarification; the second translation is correct for both.

### Structuring Questions

In English, questions are formed by flipping the verb and the subject of the sentence (often using the auxiliary verb `do`),
and moving the object to the start of the sentence if it has to be replaced with a question word.
> You murdered everyone.  
  Who did you murder?

In cases without a question word, you just flip the subject and the verb.
> You committed the murder.  
  Did you commit the murder?

\
In Billzonian, I want to change this structure to one where there is no word flipping or moving the question word to
the start of the sentence. Like so:
> Yu jakobised reghyume.  
  Yu jakobised qwo?

In cases without a question word, instead of flipping the subject
and verb, I add a particle `duz` to the end of the sentence. Like so:
> Yu akted c jakobisement.  
  Yu akted c jakobisement duz?\*

\* *The particle `duz` would be optional where a question mark would be
present or where the rising tone of one's voice would indicate a question.*

### Conjunctions

What I am currently trying to do with Billzonian is to replace the
English conjunctions with newly derived Billzonian ones.

Here is the progress of doing that so far:

| English | Billzonian |
|---------|------------|
| for     | -          |
| and     | zel        |
| nor     | -          |
| but     | howf       |
| or      | terv?      |
| yet     | -          |
| so      | therf      |
