# Plans & Progress

The current major thing I am planning to do with Billzonian is to replace the
English conjunctions with newly derived Billzonian ones.

Here is the progress of doing that so far:

| English | Billzonian |
|---------|------------|
| for     | -          |
| and     | zel        |
| nor     | -          |
| but     | howf       |
| or      | -          |
| yet     | -          |
| so      | therf      |
