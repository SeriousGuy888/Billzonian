The words [ak](../words/ak) and [unk](../words/unk) are pretty cool.

## Basic Usage
Their basic usage is quite simple, really. The word `ak` means `yes` and the word `unk` means `no`.

-----

## As Adverbs
In addition to their basic usages, they can also act as adverbs.


Take this basic example:
> So kals yumsome bea.  
> This food tastes good.

The word `unk` negates verbs, like English's `not` and `do not`.  
> So kals yumsome **unk** bea.  
> This food **does not** taste good.

The word `ak` intensifies verbs, like English's `in fact`, `do`/`does`, `actually`, or just emphasising the verb.  
> So kals yumsome **ak** bea.  
> This food **really does** taste good.
