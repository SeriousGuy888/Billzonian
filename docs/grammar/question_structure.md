## How it Works in English
In English, questions are formed by flipping the verb and the subject of the sentence, and often
using the [auxiliary verb `do`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-support),
and moving the object to the start of the sentence if it has to be replaced with a question word.
> You murdered everyone.  
> Who did you murder?

In cases without a question word, you just flip the subject and the verb.
> You committed the murder.  
> Did you commit the murder?

## Billzonian System
There is no word flipping or moving the question word to the start of the sentence.  
The first example in Billzonian would be like so:
> Thu jakobised reghyume.  
> Thu jakobised qwo?

In cases without a question word, instead of flipping the subject and verb, I add a particle `duz` to the end of the sentence.
Like so:
> Thu akted c jakobisement.  
> Thu akted c jakobisement duz?

However, the particle `duz` would be optional where a question mark would be
present or where the rising tone of one's voice would indicate a question.
Therefore, this would also be correct.
> Thu akted c jakobisement?
