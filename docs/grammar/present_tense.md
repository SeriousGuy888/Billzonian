## English System
The [present progressive tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_continuous) is represented in English using the auxiliary
word `to be` and the suffix `-ing`. As opposed to the [simple present tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_present),
which does not use any auxiliary verb.
> **PPT:** I am sleeping.  
> **SPT:** I sleep.

## Billzonian System
The present progressive tense's distinction from the simple present tense is eliminated.
Both of these sentences could correctly be translated as `I hibernate`.

### Present Simple vs Present Progressive
However, sometimes the present progressive tense sometimes conveys important information.  
Consider the following English sentences:
> The sun is setting.  
> The sun sets.

The first sentence says that the sun is setting as the speaker speaks.  
The second states merely that the sun does regularly set.

Therefore, in Billzonian, this proposition would eliminate the `-ing` suffix as well as the `to be` auxiliary verb.
However, where a distinction between the two is important, the adverb `kurrly`, meaning `currently` is used.
Therefore, the example above would translate like so:
> C sun kurrly sets.  
> C sun sets.

This adverb is optional and only is used for clarification; the second translation is correct for both.

### Past Progressive
There is also this situation in English, with the [past progressive tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_of_English_verb_forms#Past_progressive/continuous).
> I was sleeping.

This case, in Billzonian, would be:
> I prekurrly hibernate.

Notice it is `hibernate` and not `hibernated`. `I prekurrly hibernated` would be equivalent to `I already slept`.
A page that goes into more detail about the Billzonian past tense does not yet exist, but a link to it will be
place here when it does.
