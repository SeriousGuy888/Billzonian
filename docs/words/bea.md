### Conjugation
`Bea`, unlike `be`, conjugates regularly, as seen below.

| Infinitive           | tu bea      |
|---------------------:|:------------|
| I / we / you / they  | bea         |

| Past Tense           | beed / bead |

### Word Order
The word `bea` can follow [SOV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject–object–verb) word order, where the object goes before the verb. However, this word order is not mandatory. I just like to use this word order because it makes it easier for me to switch between Billzonian and English.

Both of these are correct:  
✅ I a maliceful hyume bea.  
✅ I bea a maliceful hyume.  
*I am an evil person.*
