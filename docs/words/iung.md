etymology:
  Contraction of English `I` and Billzonian [ung](ung), an old word for `not`.
  This is a fossilised contraction and it is only ever used in modern Billzonian in the phrase `iung kog`.
  In any other context, `I unk` is preferred over this contraction.
examples:
  - bzo: "**Iung** [kog](kog)."
    eng: "**I do not** know."
