# {{ page.title }}
I would like to make Billzonian become substantially different from English in 2022.
It is time for some sounds to shift and words to shorten I think.
In addition, new vocabulary shall be coined to replace English vocabulary.

-----

## Shift of /h/ to /ʃ/ before /j/ and /i/
`/hj/` and `/hi/`, spelled in some words as `hy`, `hi`, or `hu`, begins to mutate into `/ʃj/` and then to `/ʃ/`, reflected in spelling as `sh`.

> `hyume` /ˈhjum/ "human, person"  
> `shoom` /ˈʃum/

> `hir` /ˈhiɹ/ "here"  
> `shir` /ˈʃiɹ/

> `hue` /ˈhju/ "hue"  
> `shue` /ˈʃu/

## Shift of Word-Final /kt/ to /k/
Final /kt/ as in `vikt` becomes /k/, reflected in spelling as `vik`.

- `vikt` → `vik` "to win"
  - `vikteur` → `vikkeur`
  - `viktion` → `vikment`
- `insekt` → `insek` "bug, glitch"
  - `insektful` → `insekful`
- `affekt` → `affek` "to affect; to feel (emotionally)"
  - `affektion` → `affekment`
  - `effekt` → `effek`
- `kakt` → `kak` "cactus"
  - `kaktes` → `kaks`

__Special Cases__
- `konstrukt` → `trut` /ˈtʃɹʌt/
- `akt` does not change.

-----

## Shortening of Words Ending in /aɪɹ/
- `aspire` → `ar` /ˈɑɹ/
- `admire` → `mire` /ˈmaɪɹ/
- `desire` → `dzar` /ˈdzɑɹ/
  - `desirement` → `dzarment` /ˈdzɑɹmənt/

-----

  `night`
  (French *noir*)

## Respelling of "Interestsome"
The word `interestsome` is far more commonly used than its stem, `interest`.
It therefore makes sense to respell it without the silent T, since the original word is almost never used.
Maybe the silent Es should also be removed 🤔🤔🤔  
`interestsome` → `interessome` /ˈɪntʃɹɛsəm/
