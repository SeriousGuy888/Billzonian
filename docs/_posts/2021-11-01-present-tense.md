The [present progressive tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_present) is represented in English using the auxiliary
word `to be` and the suffix `-ing`. As opposed to the [simple present tense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_continuous),
which does not use any auxiliary verb.
> **PPT:** I am sleeping.  
  **SPT:** I sleep.

In Billzonian, my goal is to eliminate the present progressive tense's distinction from the simple present tense.
Both of these sentences could correctly be translated as `I hibernate`.

However, sometimes the present progressive tense sometimes conveys important information.  
Consider the following:
> The sun is setting.  
  The sun sets.

The first sentence says that the sun is setting as the speaker speaks.  
The second states merely that the sun does regularly set.

Therefore, in Billzonian, this proposition would eliminate the `-ing` suffix as well as the `to be` auxiliary verb.
However, where a distinction between the two is important, the adverb `kurrly`, meaning `currently` is used.
Therefore, the example above would translate like so:
> C sun kurrly sets.  
  C sun sets.

However, this adverb is always optional and only is used for clarification; the second translation is correct for both.
