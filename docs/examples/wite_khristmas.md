# Wite Khristmas
*A translation of White Christmas*

Kurrly weakog ov a wite Khristmas  
Just sim tey qwich I wunts rekogged  
Qwere c tree tips, tey spark  
Zel qwile chidlers hark  
Tu hark slei bells in c sno, o c sno  
> I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
> Just like the ones I used to know  
> Where the tree tops glisten  
> And children listen  
> To hear sleigh bells in the snow, oh the snow  

I voke, kurrly weakog ov a wite Khristmas  
Zith reg Khristmas rekt I type  
A'ire thy suns owosome zel bright  
Zel a'ire that reg thy Khristmases bea wite  
> I said, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
> With every Christmas card I write  
> May your days be merry and bright  
> And may all your Christmases be white
