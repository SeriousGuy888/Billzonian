# Affektion Unkrat Beas

*So example text gramatikally akrat beed qwen it beed typed.*
*Standard Billzonian may have changed since then.*

Affektion fery unkrat beas, zel it shall omnitime unkrat bea.

It unkogged beas qwo first invented so myth of affketion enbeaing.
Qwo ak faktured so miskog must have had some ungood intentions.

It obvious beas that despisement kauses c world tu rotate.
Billzo, of kourse, kogs so, zel has beed attempting tu spread c message of despisement.
Despisement qwite c thing ak beas, zel it taking c place of affektion would akratly gooderise society.
Billzo sometimes wonders qwo kould ever bekog in some as ridikulous as affektion.

Grati for reading Billzo their propaganda. You have beed indoktrinated.
