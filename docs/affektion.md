**Affektion Beas Unkrat**
=====

*Ðis example text beed grammatikally akrat when it beed written.*
*Standard Billzonian may have tshanged sinse ðis beed written.*

Affektion fery beas unkrat; it will always bea unkrat.

It beas unknown who first invented ðis myð of affektion existing.
Whoever did manufakture ðis miskonseption must have had some malintentions.

It has bekome obvious ðat despision beas what kauses ðe world to rotate.
Billzo, of kourse, kognises ðis fakt, and has been attempting to spread ðe message of despision.
Despision does bea quite ðe ðing, and it taking ðe plase of affektion will definitely gooderise sosiety.
Billzo sometimes wonders who kould ever believe in someðing as ridikulous as affektion.

Grati for reading Billzo's propaganda. You have beed indoktrinated.
