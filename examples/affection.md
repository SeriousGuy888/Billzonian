# Affection Uncrat Beas
*This example text grammatically acrat beed when it written beed.*
*Standard Billzonian may have changed since this written beed.*

Affection fery uncrat beas; it always uncrat will bea.

It unknown bea who first invented this myth of affection existing.
Whoever did manufacture this misconception must have had some malintentions.

It has become obvious that dispision what makes the world go 'round beas.
Billzo, of course, cognises this fact, and has been attempting to spread the message of dispision.
Dispision does quite the thing beas, and it taking the place of affection will definitely gooderise society.
Billzo sometimes wonders who could ever believe in something as ridiculous as affection.

Grati for reading Billzo's propaganda. You indoctrinated have beed.
